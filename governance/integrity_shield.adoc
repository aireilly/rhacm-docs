= Integrity shield protection (Technology preview)

Integrity shield is a tool that helps with integrity control for regulated cloud workloads. Integrity shield supports Open Policy Agent (OPA) and Gatekeeper, verifies if the requests have a signature, and blocks any unauthorized requests according to the defined constraint.

See the following integrity shield capabilities:

* Support the deoployment of authorized Kubernetes manifests only.
* Support zero-drift in resource configuration unless the resource is added to the allowlist.
* Perform all integrity verification on the cluster such as admission controller 
* Handle variations in application packaging and deployment (Helm /Operator /YAML / OLM Channel) with no modification in app installer
* Monitor resources continuously
